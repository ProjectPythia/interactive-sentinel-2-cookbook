    "In this notebook, we will take a look at how to retrieve Sentinel-2 L2A satellite imagery from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer Data Catalog (MSPC)](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog). We will go over how to interact with the Data Catalog, which exposes a [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/en) interface for querying, searching and retrieving data. We will use the [odc-stac](https://odc-stac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to load the data lazily, which means data is not *actually* read unless required (say, for plotting). Once loaded, we will process the data and make a simple interactive dashboard to look at the satellite imagery over a location for different seasons. We will use the [HoloViz ecosystem](https://holoviz.org/background.html) for the interactive dashboard."
